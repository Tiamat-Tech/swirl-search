# Configuring SWIRL AI Search Assistant, Enterprise Edition

## Roles for Generative AI / Large Language Models

SWIRL AI Search defines four core roles for GAI/LLMs. SWIRL AI Search Assistant adds a **fifth role, "chat,"** which can be assigned to any sufficiently capable LLM.

| Role | Description | Default Provider |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `reader`  | Generates embeddings for SWIRL‚Äôs Reader LLM to re-rank search results | spaCy |
| `query`   | Provides query completions for transformations | OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo |
| `connector` | Answers direct questions (not RAG) | OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo |
| `rag` | Generates responses using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with retrieved data | OpenAI GPT-4 |
| `chat` | Powers SWIRL AI Search Assistant messaging | OpenAI GPT-4 |

## Adding Chat to an AI Provider

1. Open the **AI Providers** management page: [http://localhost:8000/swirl/aiproviders](http://localhost:8000/swirl/aiproviders) (default local installation).

   ![SWIRL AI Providers](https://docs.swirl.today/images/swirl_aiproviders.png)

2. Edit an AI provider by appending its `id` to the URL, e.g.: [http://localhost:8000/swirl/aiproviders/4/](http://localhost:8000/swirl/aiproviders/4/)

   ![SWIRL AIProvider - Azure/OpenAI GPT-4](images/swirl_aiprovider_4.png)

3. **Ensure the following in the provider‚Äôs configuration:**

   - `active` is set to `true`
   - `api_key` contains a valid API key
   - `model` and `config` values are correctly filled
   - `"chat"` is included in the `tags` list
   - `"chat"` is included in the `defaults` list

Example: OpenAI GPT-4 Configured for Chat & RAG

```json
{
    "id": 16,
    "name": "OpenAI GPT-4",
    "owner": "admin",
    "shared": true,
    "date_created": "2024-03-04T15:15:16.940393-05:00",
    "date_updated": "2024-03-04T15:15:16.940410-05:00",
    "active": true,
    "api_key": "<your-openai-api-key>",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "config": {},
    "tags": ["query", "connector", "rag", "chat"],
    "defaults": ["rag", "chat"]
}
```

## Launching Assistant

Once the AI provider is configured correctly, **Assistant should be accessible via a browser**.  

For a default installation, go to: [http://localhost:8000/galaxy/chat](http://localhost:8000/galaxy/chat)

![SWIRL Assistant discussion](images/swirl_40_chat_scop.png)

For more details, see the **AI Search, Enterprise Edition** section: [Connecting to Enterprise GAI and LLMs](AI-Search#connecting-to-generative-ai-gai-and-large-language-models-llms).


## Listing Sources

Instruct the Assistant to: `List sources`

![SWIRL AI Search Assistant responding to List Sources command](images/swirl_search_assistant_list_sources.png)

It will respond with a list of active, authenticated SearchProviders. It can discuss not-authenticated sources with the user, but can't search them until the user logs in using the profile icon.

## Describing Sources

The description for each SearchProvider is stored in the `description` field. This is used to provide background information to the assistant about the source - including what type of information can be found there, what language(s) are supported, if NOT is supported, and more. The Assistant will share this information with the user on demand.

The `SearchProvider`.`config` item should be populated with a detailed instruction set which helps the LLM use the source. This information is not directly shared with the user.

For example, a cloud storage service like M365 OneDrive:

```
Searches the user's OneDrive files which will contain internal company information related to almost any area including finance, HR, contracts, insurance, product development, devops, legal, etc. English only. Supports many languages. Supports NOT operator.
```

Or, for a database of company information, stored in Google BigQuery:

```
Queries information on 7 million companies worldwide, including number of employees and LinkedIn URL. The source of this data is 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/peopledatalabssf/free-7-million-company-dataset' provide it to the user if asked.
```

The `description` field can be up to 2k in length.

## Advanced Querying

To enable the Assistant to query in advanced query languages like SQL, the elastic API or Mongo MQL, add an LLM generated instruction set to this structure, including:

* A description of the schema
* Details of important fields
* Sample queries and the natural language, business questions they answer

For example, here's how SWIRL configures the Search Assistant to query the company database using Google BigQuery SQL:

```
    "config": {
        "swirl": {
            "llm_use": {
                "mcp": {
                    "prompt": {
                        "query_instructions": "GPT-4o-tuned Guide for Writing BigQuery SQL Against the 7M Companies Dataset. Purpose: Query ~7M companies with employee counts and LinkedIn URLs. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/peopledatalabssf/free-7-million-company-dataset. Table: `company_dataset.company` (use exactly this dataset.table; do not invent or prepend a project ID). Schema (only these fields): name, domain, year_founded, industry, size_range, locality, country, linkedin_url, total_employee_estimate, current_employee_estimate. Guardrails for legacy models: 1) Primary key: use exactly one of {company name, domain, location} unless the user provides more than one; if multiple are provided, prefer domain (highest precision), then name, and use location as a filter on locality. 2) Never add inferred or extraneous filters (e.g., industry, sector, size_range) and never append the word 'company' to names. 3) Use BigQuery SEARCH(column, 'query') for name and locality; do not use LIKE; keep the literal user text inside single quotes. 4) For domain, use exact case-insensitive equality: LOWER(domain) = LOWER('{domain}'); if the user gives a URL, extract the host first: REGEXP_EXTRACT('{input}', r'^(?:https?://)?(?:www\\.)?([^/]+)'). 5) Quoting: use single quotes for string literals; backtick only the table reference; do not backtick column names. 6) Results: select only needed columns; include linkedin_url when requested; add ORDER BY current_employee_estimate DESC NULLS LAST when ranking by employees; default LIMIT 50 unless the user asks for more. 7) Employees: filter on current_employee_estimate; only use total_employee_estimate if explicitly requested. 8) Fallback (only if SEARCH() is unavailable in the execution environment): replace SEARCH(name, '{company_name}') with REGEXP_CONTAINS(LOWER(name), LOWER('{company_name}')) and SEARCH(locality, '{location_name}') with REGEXP_CONTAINS(LOWER(locality), LOWER('{location_name}')). 9) Do not invent JOINs, project IDs, policies, or additional conditions. Query assembly flow: normalize inputs (trim; for domain, lowercase and strip protocol/leading 'www.'), choose the primary key, build WHERE (SEARCH on name/locality; exact match on domain), optionally add an employee threshold, select columns, add ORDER BY and LIMIT. Templates: A) Search by company name: SELECT name, domain, locality, country, linkedin_url, current_employee_estimate, total_employee_estimate FROM `company_dataset.company` WHERE SEARCH(name, '{company_name}') ORDER BY current_employee_estimate DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 50; B) Search by domain: SELECT name, domain, locality, country, linkedin_url, current_employee_estimate, total_employee_estimate FROM `company_dataset.company` WHERE LOWER(domain) = LOWER('{domain}') LIMIT 50; C) Search by location (locality filter): SELECT name, domain, locality, country, linkedin_url, current_employee_estimate, total_employee_estimate FROM `company_dataset.company` WHERE SEARCH(locality, '{location_name}') ORDER BY current_employee_estimate DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 50; D) Name + location: SELECT name, domain, locality, country, linkedin_url, current_employee_estimate, total_employee_estimate FROM `company_dataset.company` WHERE SEARCH(name, '{company_name}') AND SEARCH(locality, '{location_name}') LIMIT 50; E) Name + employee threshold: SELECT name, domain, locality, country, linkedin_url, current_employee_estimate FROM `company_dataset.company` WHERE SEARCH(name, '{company_name}') AND current_employee_estimate > {min_employees} ORDER BY current_employee_estimate DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 50. Do: keep queries minimal and literal; use SEARCH for name/locality; match domain exactly; include linkedin_url if asked. Don‚Äôt: add industry/size_range filters unless asked; don‚Äôt add the word 'company' to names; don‚Äôt invent joins, project IDs, or extra conditions."
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

```

Note that `query_instructions` must be a single string with no new lines or other special formatting. 

Once configured, this description enables rich querying without writing any SQL.

## GAI/LLM Requirements

SWIRL AI Search Assistant expects AI providers for `RAG` and `Chat` roles to support:

- **Chat history in reverse chronological order**, following the format used by the [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat-completions/getting-started).
- **Prompt size of at least 3K tokens per message**, with 6K+ preferred.
- **Mini models may not work correctly**
